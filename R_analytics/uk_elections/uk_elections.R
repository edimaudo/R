#Q2 
#use unpaired two sample t-test
#The unpaired two-samples t-test is used to compare the mean of two independent groups.

#hypothesis test
#whether the mean of group A (mAmA) is greather than the mean of group B (mBmB)?
#can't compute do welch t-test manually

#Q4
#look at the p-values of the different coefficients to explain the impact
#Also look at the r-square value to see how much it interrpets
