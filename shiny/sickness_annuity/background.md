## Sickness Linked Annuity Model
***

### Background

The goal is to check if an annuity product that pays out subject to the current level of health of the policyholder. The company is considering three health states to be applicable in this product: healthy, light-sickness and heavy-sickness is feasible
Investigate the feasibility of the product by a four-state Markov model (i.e. only the current age and state of a life affect the future transition rates), which is made up by three transition states (representing the alive states) and an absorbing state (representing death). The outcome would be deterministic and stochoatic model that models the population dynamics in these four states based on pre-determined transition rates between the Markov states at each age for an overall age range of 65 to 120.
