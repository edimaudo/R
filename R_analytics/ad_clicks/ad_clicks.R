#Problem Statement
#A leading affiliate network company from Europe wants to leverage machine learning to 
#improve (optimise) their conversion rates and eventually their topline. 
#Their network is spread across multiple countries in europe such as Portugal, 
#Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland etc.

#Affiliate network is a form of online marketing channel where an intermediary promotes 
#products / services and earns commission based on conversions (click or sign up). 
#The benefit companies sees in using such affiliate channels is that, 
#they are able to reach to audience which doesnâ€™t exist in their marketing reach.
#The company wants to improve their CPC (cost per click) performance. 
#A future insight about an ad performance will give them enough headstart 
#to make changes (if necessary) in their upcoming CPC campaigns.

#Objective
#In this challenge, you have to predict the probability whether an ad will get clicked or not.
