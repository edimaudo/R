### What is this app?

The app that simulates the monty hall problem. 

### Background
After a strange turn of events, you find your self as a contestant in the popular game show “Let’s Make a Deal”. You make your way to the final challenge, which promises a brand-new car as the prize.
Challenge is the following:

- There are 3 doors, behind which are two goats and a car.

- You pick a door (call it door A). You’re hoping for the car of course.

- Monty Hall, the game show host, examines the other doors (B & C), opens one and always reveals a goat. (If both doors have goats,he randomly picks one to open.)

- After the revelation, you have the option to change your pick (you can switch to other still closed door)

Should you switch or keep your original pick?
