#Questions to Address

# What is Your Public Health Topic?
# The objective is to understand oral health care across the globe
# from across the world
  
## What is the research question?
# Understanding the relationship between oral health plans and dentists
  
## What is the Null Hypothesis?
#The null hypothesis is that  Number of Dentists per 10,000 residents	
#has an impact on Existence of operational policy/strategy/action plan for oral health 
  
#What is the Alternative Hypothesis?
#Number of Dentists per 10,000 residents	
#does not have an impact on Existence of operational policy/strategy/action plan for oral health 
  
#What Research Method will be used?(Quantitative or Qualitative?)
#Quantitative since the key variables are Quantitative


#What Research Study Design will be used?
#Logistic regession will be applied because 
    
#How Many Samples will be used? (One, Two, or More?)
#One sample

#What level of alpha would you set to test your hypothesis? 
#95%
  
##Can you address how to avoid Type I and/or Type II errors? 
#The probability of a type 1 error (rejecting a true null hypothesis) can be minimized by picking a smaller level of significance 
#Î± before doing a test (requiring a smaller p-value for rejecting H0).

#Once the level of significance is set, the probability of a type 2 error 
#(failing to reject a false null hypothesis) can be minimized either by picking a larger sample size or 
#by choosing a "threshold" alternative value of the parameter in question that is further from the 
#null value
  
##Are you able to calculate a point estimate and/or a confidence interval with the information given?
#Yes - see model output
  
##Why did you pick the above descriptive and inferential statistics? 
#Inferential statictics was utlized since it would help in giving better
#insight into the research question
