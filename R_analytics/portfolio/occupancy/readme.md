data set has 20560 rows and 7 attributes which are divided into 3 data sets for training and testing.
The data set provides experimental data used for binary classification (room occupancy of an office room) from Temperature, Humidity, Light and CO2. 
Ground-truth occupancy was obtained from time stamped pictures that were taken every minute
