# Oxford Properties manages a shopping center, Yorkdale mall, and they track the movement of 
#each customer in mall
# Movements tracked using sensors
# Sensors get a ping from smart phones
# 70% of customers come in with smart phones
# Sensors are 90-95% accurate
# The sensor technology: https://www.aislelabs.com
# Keeps track of which stores customers enter, how long they are in a store, etc
# Dataset contains two primary tables:
#   Visits
# Date
# User meta data: postal code, gender, age-range
# Unordered list of stores visited
# Name of store, length of time stayed
# Store
# Metadata about each store
# Distance to each other store; distance to entrance; etc.

# Your tasks: analyze the data to find interesting patterns that Oxford Properties might be interested in
# Which stores are visited together most/least frequently?
#   Do they change by time of day, day of week, time of year?
#   Which stores are most frequently visited together that aren't that close together?
# Etc. Anything you want, really!
