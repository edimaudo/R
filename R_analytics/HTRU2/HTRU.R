# Write script for quick exploratory analysis to the data. In particular:
#   -	Class distribution in the dataset
# -	Other relevant information about the dataset
# -	Carry out pre-processing (i.e features relation, data normalisation, etcâ€¦)
# -	Drop irrelevant features (should be clearly explained and justified)
# Codes must be commented, and steps explained. Produce at least two diagrams that explains the dataset in the link.
# 
# 2. Build a classification model to classify/predict the class label in the dataset using any classification model 
# (any of these SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks or any other less complex classification model).
# You must justify your choice of the method used, write, explain and comment the code produced to complete this task.
# The codes must:
# 1.	Divide the set into training and testing subsets
# 2.	Build a model of choice using the training set
# 3.	Test and evaluate the model
# 4.	Report and discuss results
# Now, you are required to improve the performance of the above model and try to get better results. 
# There are different ways to improve and fine tune the model. More specifically, try to explore one or more of these options below:
# 1.Fine tune the parameters of the model, or search for some existing techniques to optimise these parameters
# 2.Use different metrics for evaluating the model 
# (i.e perhaps the data is not balanced, and you might want to keep trying some other methods
# 3.Use different models and compare the results
# 4.Change the partitioning of the dataset. In some cases, more training data may help
# 5.Use cross-validation if not used already
# 6.Any other methods you think might be appropriate to use
